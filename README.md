## Arbetsprocess
- We use github for versionmanagement
- `main` = stable code (noone works directly in here).
- `develop` = developmentbranch, into here we merge completed features.
- New features are created in feature branches `feature/*`, `feature/add-account`.
- When a feature is done a **Pull Request** is made to `develop`.
- Atleast 1 review is required for a pullrequest to merge 

## Usage
Create an account by talking to an admin(log in to premade with 'emma' *12345*)
When logged in you can create new accounts, deposit money, withdraw money or transfer money between accounts or users.
You can show all accounts with positive balance and show your top 3 transactions
